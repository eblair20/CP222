Implement the IDict interface backed by a list and binary search tree. Name the list backed implementation "Dict" and the BST backed implementation "BSTree". The files "shortlist.txt" and "words_alpha.txt" should not be committed to your repository.

You should copy over your best list implementation from day 4 to use as the list in the Test program.

Files:
Test.java  - A program that reads in words and randomly searches for them
IList.java - An interface for a list implementation (matches day4)
IDict.java - An interface for dictionaries
shortlist.txt - a 50000 word list
words_alpha.txt - a 370098 word list

DoubleLinkList.java - Used to add words to an array for the dictionary
DoubleLinkPair.java - Modified DoubleLinkList that implements two generics for key and value
DLink.java - Nodes for DoubleLinkList.java
DLink2.java - Nodes for DoubleLinkPair.java
IDLink.java - Interface for DLink.java
IDLink2.java - Interface for DLink2.java
TreeNode.java - Creates the nodes for the binary search tree with two different generics
BSTree.java - A binary search tree
Dict.java - A dicitonary backed by the list implementatino in DoubleLinkPair.java
